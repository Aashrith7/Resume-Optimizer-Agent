# Resume Optimizer Agent 🤖  

An AI-powered agent that analyzes and optimizes resumes using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as GPT, LangChain, and CrewAI.  
It helps users tailor their resumes to match job descriptions by enhancing keyword relevance, readability, and overall impact.

## 🚀 Overview

The **Resume Optimizer Agent** leverages the power of AI to intelligently evaluate and rewrite resumes.  
By combining **LangChain** and **CrewAI**, the system can understand a candidate’s profile and a given job description, then provide smart recommendations — ensuring your resume is **ATS-friendly**, **keyword-rich**, and **professionally phrased**.

This project demonstrates how LLMs and multi-agent systems can be applied to real-world NLP use cases like career optimization.
